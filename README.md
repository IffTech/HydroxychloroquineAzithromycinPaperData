In an effort to help in the battle against COVID-19, the team at Iff Technologies has used our quantum algorithm for protiein binding site modeling to come up with the binding sites that exist within the interaction complex that exists between the SARS-COV-2 virus spike (S) protein and the ACE2 enzyme that helps in blood flow circulation. 

Within this repository you will find: 

6lzgafterpolarplus.pdb -> This is a pdb file of the atoms related to the top binding sites. This can help in narrowing down the total number of binding targets used by docking software, such as SwissDock and Autodock, for docking simulation.
